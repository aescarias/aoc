# aocutils

`aocutils` include utilities for making Advent of Code less repetitive.

While each Advent of Code challenge is different, they usually share common elements such as parsing inputs, working with grid-like systems and tokenizing among a few others.

`aocutils` is designed to remove the repetition these elements tend to cause to allow more focus towards the actual challenge details.
